# Book Recommender with LLMs

The semantic book recommneder is composed of five components:
- Text data cleaning (code in the notebook data-exploration.ipynb)
- Semantic (vector) search and how to build a vector database (code in the notebook vector-search.ipynb). This allows users to find the most similar books to a natural language query (e.g., "a book about a person seeking revenge").
- Doing text classification using zero-shot classification in LLMs (code in the notebook text-classification.ipynb). This allows us to classify the books as "fiction" or "non-fiction", creating a facet that users can filter the books on.
- Doing sentiment analysis using LLMs and extracting the emotions from text (code in the notebook sentiment-analysis.ipynb). This will allow users to sort books by their tone, such as how suspenseful, joyful or sad the books are.
- Creating a web application using Gradio for users to get book recommendations (code in the file gradio-dashboard.py).
